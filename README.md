## Agile Process
The Agile process used here is very simple as there is only one developer, it shouldn't be complicated at all.

This has been done simply using Clickup as the board management tool:
- The Challange itself has been separated into mini-tasks.
- Each task has simply 3 statuses (TODO, In Progress, Completed), acceptance criteria, time-estimation and due-date, also comments if needed.
- The tasks hasn't been written as a user-stories, it was much simpler and better to be segregatted as a technical-based stories that fits with the challenge target.
